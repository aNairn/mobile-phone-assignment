	<h2>Adam's Contributions</h2>

        <p>Adam will discuss the topic of right to repair and planned obsolescence in the smartphone market. This refers to the consumer of a smartphone being allowed to perform repairs to components of their device if they are damaged or lose functionality and planned obsolescence refers to a business practice where a smartphone becomes less responsive, drains battery life faster and more issues to heavily encourage the consumer to upgrade their device to a newer model earlier than they anticipated as the hardware is still as capable as it was previously.</p>

	<h2>Michael's Contributions</h2>

	<p>Michael will discuss the topic of e-waste and landfills. In this I will talk about what e-waste is and why it is becoming more of a problem. the growing impact of e-waste that it has on the environment as well as to people's health. As the production rate of the number of electronic gadgets increases this poses a big question for how we as a society are going to try to tackle the e-waste problem by recycling. I will also discuss how the bigger countries deal with this problem and the negative effects on this morally and as well environmentally as well as the statistics that go along with that.</p>

	<h2>Andy's Contributions</h2>

<p>Robert Nairn is looking at the waste and emissions of mobile phone factories and the problems associated with them such as hazardous components and unsafe working environments, as well as, the extraction of finite natural resources from mines around the world which can lead to destabilisation in the region.</p>

	<h2>Lewis's Contributions</h2>

<p>Lewis McGregor is looking at the effect of plastic phone cases. This will involve the effect of billions of plastic phone cases sold each year and how most people get rid of them. I will look at how the mass dumping/burning of these plastic phone cases and batteries are causing a lot of damage to our bodies and planet. It will also involve a little ways to discard a phone case correctly.</p>
