        <p>There are around billions of people that own a smartphone nowadays and there is a lot of damage that can be done and is being done to our planet and environment. My points will be focusing on the waste and e waste that mobile phone cases cause and I will also talk about some methods we ourselves can do to slow down or even stop this ever growing problem. There are many problems that I will talk about here but the main problem is the over-production of plastic phone cases and how these cases are being mostly discarded in a damaging way. Now most people will decide to invest in a phone case that will protect their new phone. In fact china manufactures around 700 million phone cases per year and with the average weight of a phone case being 20 grams. This means that China has used over 14 million kilos of plastic just on these phone cases alone. Now imagine what happens to these cases when people are done with these. A lot of people will buy these phone cases cheap and not bother about it when they are done using it. So they decide to throw it away as it was cheap. Once this person has thrown it away it will lie there for years as these plastics can take up to 450 years to decompose. With the average person buying a new phone case every 21 months this means that this process will be repeated by many other people which will cause a huge pileup of plastics that we cannot get rid of.  In America the average waste of plastics was 9.4 tons. This means that all of this plastic is just littering our planet in waste. Another way we deal with what seems like an everlasting flow of plastic is to mass burn these phone cases. This does get rid of them but has many negative side effects that will and are causing detrimental effects to our climate. When these plastics are burned they release many toxics fumes that will not only damage us if someone were to breathe these fumes in but also they will rise up into our atmosphere and they will spread all over the world. In fact in these fumes are chemicals called phthalates and manufacturers of these cases add phthalates to make their plastic more flexible and durable. When these are inhaled they can create a zinc deficiency which can lead to heart disease, lung cancer and diabetes. Other chemicals are also released from cases being burned such as dioxins which will rise up into the atmosphere heating up our sky and the result of this is climate change around the whole world. These toxins also damage plant life. When the chemicals rise it also clashes with our rain water. This causes acid rain to be created which these plants need and instead of getting the water they need they are getting harmful chemicals that will eventually kill off these plants.

Some reasons that could help stop this pandemic of plastic that is rising every year could be: Constructing more recycling plants. Some people may litter their old phone case as there is not a recycling plant near them that is convenient to go to. The uk does not have enough recycling plants to keep up with the rate of waste created each year as in 2018 the uk were exporting 492,000 tons to many countries such as China, Thailand and Poland just so they did not get overrun by the plastic waste. China has since banned all contaminated recycling from coming into their country and the UK's numbers have been rising rapidly since. If more plants were built for people to drop off their old phone cases and plastic waste then the rate of these cases being dumped anywhere will drop.
