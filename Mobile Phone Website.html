	<p>We agreed on the theme of mobile phones and the e-waste that they generate from manufacturing, planned obsolescence and raw material usage. We had 4 of us working on the project so we brainstormed 4 general bullet points relating to the theme and planned to write out roughly 2 pages of information each from many different sources. We aimed to have the plan finished by Tuesday 4th ahead of the deadline and have the 2 pages of information finished by Tuesday 11th ahead of the deadline. We aim to have made a start on the code for our website, starting with the CSS file and general layout, by the 15th before having it completed by the 22nd, including the navigation tools and bibliography, to allow time to test it and make any necessary changes to errors found and graphical bugs.</p>

	<p>Once the information is gathered together we will create a basic but functional html file to insert the research data into. Then once the html file works as intended in a web browser and displays the paragraphs of research information properly we will add a css file to the html file to improve the graphics and make the website more appealing to users. We will add images, colours and formatting to make the webpage more aesthetically pleasing and easier to read for the user. While adding css elements we will be constantly checking over the html file in a browser to ensure the css changes are being displayed as intended and look appealing.</p>
