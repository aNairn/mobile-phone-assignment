<p>E-waste is any electronic waste that contains anything with plugs, cords and electronic components. This can be anything from computers to children’s toys that are put to waste. E-waste occurs when electronic devices that are no longer in use are not disposed of in the right manner and they end up in landfills instead. This leads to toxic substances such as lead, and mercury ending up being absorbed into the soil and water as <a href="Bibliography.html#Lotzof, K.">Lotzof, K.</a> (2020). The issue of electronic waste was once described by the UN’s chief of the environment as a “tsunami rolling out over all the world” as <a href="Bibliography.html#Fitri, A.">Fitri, A.</a> (2022).  Some electronics contain non-renewable resources such as gold, platinum and cobalt. This then means that if you don’t correctly dispose of them, it means you are giving away materials instead of recycling. Recycling is a much better option compared to having high-quality parts being sent to wastelands however it does come with its own moral and ethical issues. The processes are lengthy, and countries are also passing on the challenge to dispose of the electronics to other countries where the labour laws and safety are not air-tight whatsoever and give the workers much protection from the hazardous work that they must partake in to earn a living. This then adds to the gap in living quality between powerful countries and third-world countries as some countries are sending all their waste to poorer countries such as south and east Asia, Africa and India, who will have workers who will be cheap labour as well as working in horrific conditions and some cases, these workers will be children whose entire village will sort out components as <a href="Bibliography.html#Lotzof, K.">Lotzof, K.</a> (2020).  This highlights to us the vast difference that there is in many children’s lives across the world and shows us how difficult it is for these children in some of the world’s poorer countries just they can earn a very small amount of money so they can try to help their family in any way. This then leads to a massive gap in the quality of education children across the world receive as many of these children working to sort components do not attend a school which then puts them into a poverty cycle as they will have no qualifications. <br> <br></p>

<p>“E-waste is labelled by the European Union as hazardous waste” <a href="Bibliography.html#Fitri, A.">Fitri, A.</a> (2022) because of all the toxic parts that are contained within it. Exports of the e-waste to non-EU countries have been made illegal under new EU law.' This would then allow the countries to know exactly where their e-waste has come from which then in turn makes it much easier for them to dispose of it as the countries will then be able to develop a sustainable plan for how to dispose of the electronics in a safe but effective manner. “Professor Richard Herrington, Head of Earth Sciences at the Museum says, what we need is to be manufacturing products here and keeping a better handle on where materials are within products. We should be designing them so they are more readily recyclable - better labelling and construction would allow componentry to be more readily reused and precious minerals, rescued from landfill. “ as <a href="Bibliography.html#Lotzof, K.">Lotzof, K.</a> (2020).   <br> <br></p>

<p>Researchers from BAN placed trackers on a huge number of electronic devices, and LCDs placed in recycling facilities in numerous nations to better understand where exactly the final destination of e-waste will be as <a href="Bibliography.html#Fitri, A.">Fitri, A.</a> (2022). Although a small proportion of gadgets were seen to be sent to countries such as Belgium, Austria and Hungary, the bulk of e-waste from Europe was exported to poorer countries like Ghana.  From the same report, it found that the “UK exported the most amount of e-waste shipments to developing countries after detectors were placed onto several computers that exactly showed where the exact location of it which showed that the devices travelled from Scotland and England to dumps across the world” as <a href="Bibliography.html#Fitri, A.">Fitri, A.</a> (2022). This is an issue as the UK is loading off a huge amount of e-waste and it seems their plan is just to pass on the problem to a smaller country. Although the main issue here is not disposing of the E-waste there is also the fuel consumption that is needed for moving this waste and the effect that this will have on the environment. However, in 2019 an investigation by the Basel Action Network found that “there is still some e-waste in the richer European countries however they seem to have a more effective recycling process.” Although, it is Africa that has the largest amount of e-waste with over 60% of the EU’s e-waste ending up there eventually. <br> <br></p>

<p>E-waste is set to hit 75 megatons by 2030 with no serious plan in place to help reduce this. Over the past 15 years, we have seen an increase year on year in the amount of e-waste that is being produced which highlights the fact that the average person is not being educated on the dangers of e-waste by the big tech companies as well as the governing bodies which was found from <a href="Bibliography.html#Fitri, A.">Fitri, A.</a> (2022). There needs to be a huge culture change in the way we as a society dispose of e-waste and this needs to be done by tech companies who are ultimately creating this waste as well as these companies the governments of countries need to identify the extent of this problem and more robust procedures in place to tackle this. The amount of e-waste increasing is also down to the fact that the scale of electronic items is growing at an intense rate which inevitably leads to more e-waste being produced as it is not being disposed of correctly. <br> <br></p>

<p>Household appliances take up the biggest percentage of e-waste produced which may come as a shock to some people.” The EU has stated that household appliances produce over 30 metric tonnes of e-waste in 2020. Whereas screens and monitors take up 6.7 metric tonnes and bulbs and LEDs take up only 0.9 metric tonnes.” One of the reasons giving as to why household items take up such a large proportion of e-waste is due to just their size as household items tend to include bigger items such as a fridge would be classed under the larger household appliances. As well as these small household appliances still carry a significant amount of mass compared to mobile phones, for example, small household appliances include kettles. This contributes to a massive amount of e-waste as most household appliances carry a significant weight compared to most other electronic items. <br> <br></p>

<p>Not only is e-waste bad for the environment it can also have a detrimental effect on a person’s health as well. However, the two topics are very different, they are both linked. Arsenic which is found in mobile phones pollutes soil and groundwater. Exposure to this increases your chance of getting lung cancer, nerve damage, and numerous skin diseases. These risks become more apparent at informal disposable sites. This is since a large amount of e-waste recycling happens here however when people try to recover certain materials they are usually underprepared and don’t have the appropriate protective equipment for them to remain safe throughout their time there as <a href="Bibliography.html#Wei, L. and Liu, Y.">Wei, L. and Liu, Y.</a> (2012). These activities can also include burning electronic equipment as well as opening a device yourself. This results in longer exposure time to which could be harmful substances. Children who are in the presence of e-waste face a greater risk of suffering from obesity and asthma. <br> <br></p>

<p>Even though the problem is rapidly coming to a real issue most countries do not have any laws in place to try to tackle this problem. A study showed that only 32 countries have a policy to try to tackle the problem whilst over double that number of countries currently have no plans at all to tackle it from <a href="Bibliography.html#Fitri, A.">Fitri, A.</a> (2022). . Although most countries aren’t doing their bit to help reduce e-waste many of the big tech companies are leading the way. Vodafone has stated that they have recycled 99% of the waste it produces in a year and virgin media has created a new fund to provide help to people to get second-hand electronics to reduce the number of new devices made. <br> <Br></p>
