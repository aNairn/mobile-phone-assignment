        <p>The Smartphone has become an indispensable communication and information tool for millions of people worldwide. However, the creation of each smartphone creates a lot of waste in the manufacturing process and the vast amounts of hazardous raw materials needed to create smartphones are frequently sourced from third world countries and war-torn regions, creating environmental disasters. Therefore, it is important to consider how creating these devices impacts the environment and to lower the rate of production if possible.</p>
<p>A smartphone’s creation is the most contaminating part of its life cycle. According to <a href="Bibliography.html#Deloitte Insights.">Deloitte Insights.</a> (2022) “A brand-new smartphone generates an average of 85 kilograms of emissions in its first year of use. Around ninety-five percent of this carbon footprint comes from the manufacturing processes, including the extraction of raw materials and shipping.” This is a result of the cutting-edge tech in modern smartphones requiring dozens of chemical elements and rare earth metals to produce: “iron for the speakers and microphones, aluminium and magnesium for the frames and screen, copper, silver and gold for the electronic circuits, graphite and lithium for the batteries, silicon for the processor, and lead and tin for the soldering’s.” (<a href="Bibliography.html#Martín, B.">Martín, B.</a>, 2020)</p>
<p>These finite resources are extracted from mines all over the globe, often with poor environmental records and that have little or no protection for workers’ rights. Mining for these components is deeply problematic requiring energy intensive mining. As well as atmospheric pollution, the process damages local ecosystems and produces toxic by-products which contaminate the water and soil in the region. For example, the screen is made of quartz, which is mined in the USA and aluminium, which possibly came from Australia. For the scratch resistant coating it is treated with iridium from South Korea and tin from Indonesia. The electronic components inside could include copper from Chile, silver from Mexico, platinum from South Africa and tungsten from Russia. Most of the rare earth elements which give the screen its colour come from China. The mining of these elements has resulted in toxic lakes in Inner Mongolia and contributed to air pollution and the contamination of land used for agriculture, leading to severe public health risks. The rechargeable battery in the phone is made of lithium from Argentina, cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo and pure graphite from India. Based on information from the US department of the interior via <a href="Bibliography.html#Bureau of Economic Geology.">Bureau of Economic Geology</a> (2017).</p>
<p>The extraction of these resources has brought condemnation from numerous NGOs, including Friends of the Earth, Global Witness, Amnesty International, and Engineers Without Borders among others, in particular the use of conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten) which have led to human rights violation. These come mostly from “artisanal” mines in areas controlled by rebel groups which stand outside the sphere of regulation of governments. Many such areas of conflict or high risk are situated in the DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) and contribute to its instability. Beyond conflict minerals, cobalt should also be included (though not officially classified as a conflict mineral) as it is also mined in catastrophic social and environmental conditions. These different minerals are at the centre of international concern, especially because they constitute the main source of financing for numerous armed and rebel groups. According to <a href="Bibliography.html#Amnesty International.">Amnesty International</a>, (2016), they are the main actual causes of conflicts in mining regions and contribute to the perpetration and extension of these conflicts at the regional/sub-continental level. Several international organisations also condemn the corruption they generate, underlining the necessity for regulating more strictly the trade of these minerals.</p>
<p>Once the resources have been extracted, they are transported to a manufacturing facility, usually in Asia. These factories tend to specialise in the manufacture of particular components which may be used by many different brands.</p>
<p>More than 18 million people work in the electronics manufacturing sector, and 100 million more are employed in the mining of raw materials. They endure a number of cruel conditions; child labour, dangerous working conditions, poor safety standards and extreme poverty are all common in the industry (<a href="Bibliography.html#Fairphone. (2017)">Fairphone</a>, 2017). Codes of conduct and audits are often imposed by household name phone manufacturers on facilities in their supply chain as a means of trying to insure they adhere to safe working practices, but these frequently don't address the more serious, systemic problems like excessive overtime and inadequate pay. Workers frequently feel unable to voice their grievances or seek the help of unions because doing so could result in them losing their jobs. Most of the time, the wages paid do not cover the workers' and their families' fundamental expenses. Moreover, deductions are typically made from their pay when they make mistakes or when productivity is regarded as inadequate. Additionally, reports of forced labour are frequently documented, Women and kids are especially susceptible to these treatments. NGOs also stress that wage progressing is constrained, and the inadequate social insurance system also prevents workers from receiving the benefits from social security or any retirement payments (<a href="Bibliography.html#Kroutchinin, Y and Baudrier, L.">Kroutchinin and Baudrier</a>, 2019).</p>
<p>The single biggest thing that could help reduce the environmental impact of smartphones would be to extend the lifespan of each device, reducing the demand for new devices. One particular challenge is the tendency of users to opt to replace their phone, rather than repairing it to extend its lifespan. YouGov data from 2020 showed that 45% of UK smartphone users would rather replace than repair a faulty or damaged device, with more than half citing cost as a factor (<a href="Bibliography.html#Nolsoe, E.">Nolsoe</a>, 2020). This could be improved as a result of the ‘Right to Repair’ campaign. There is also a growing movement to recycle old phones and extract the valuable minerals and finite resources to be reused in new devices thus also reducing the need to mine these resources.</p>
