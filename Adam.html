        <p> Right to repair in the UK is defined as a consumer's right to make repairs to the products they purchase, this includes electronics and more importantly smart phones. Manufacturers of smart phones such as Samsung, Xiaomi and Apple would much rather sell you a new device as soon as your old one breaks as this generates more profits for them. However, this creates more e-waste as repairable devices are left on shelves, unused, instead of completing a fairly straightforward repair by a qualified technician that could make the device usable again and be able to sell it on the second-hand market. Smart phone planned obsolescence is defined as "The devices in the commercial consumer market that are planned to fail before their realistic lifespan".- UX Planet editor <a href="Bibliography.html#Shaunak Bhanarkar">Shaunak Bhanarkar</a>. This means that smartphone manufacturers intentionally slow down their devices over time to a point where the user feels it is necessary to upgrade to a newer model earlier than they had anticipated. This problem results in millions of smartphones each year becoming unusable and therefore becoming e-waste when the hardware was still capable of providing functionality for potentially many more years. </p>
  
        <br> Apple has been famously caught partaking in this practice in 2014-2016 claiming they were concerned that batteries would degrade to a point that they would be unsafe to use at full power. Apple has many anti-3rd party repair mechanisms in place in their iPhone operating system (iOS) to stop individuals from self-repairing their iPhones if a component fails such as screen, battery, or cameras. These mechanisms include software locking certain features such as after a front camera replacement on an iPhone X or newer the Face ID security feature gets completely locked and loses all functionality. Apple claims this is for security as the Face ID credentials are confidential and Apple does not allow for third party Face ID infrared scanners to be used to unlock software in iOS. This is done by each component of a brand-new iPhone being serial number matched to the phone's chipset and if a replacement component is inserted into the phone, by a technician not registered by Apple, the software recognises this and rejects the component and intentionally blocks certain functionality.
     
        <br> However, Apple have recently gone in the other direction and begun a self-service repair program which focuses on documenting basic repairs on their devices including the iPhone and supplying small businesses or individual repair enthusiasts with the necessary, official parts to do the repairs effectively. This seems like a pro right to repair move however the service is heavily monitored by Apple and each small business or individual must register with Apple and pay a fee to be able to purchase official parts from Apple. As well as this Apple also still requires the new component that replaced the broken one to be calibrated by a certified Apple technician usually done over a text messaging service to rematch the new component's serial number to the original iPhone's chipset.
     
        <br> To contrast with Apple's very restricted stance on right to repair there is a Dutch mobile phone manufacturer called Fairphone whose goal has been to make the most modular and repairable smartphone on the market. The phone has modern hardware and can be fully dismantled and put back together just using an included screwdriver in a few minutes. Fairphone provides replacement components for a majority of the phone's parts that have a tendency to fail, from the display to charging port to cameras. Fairphone is an example of the fact that phones can be made sustainable but the larger manufacturers disregard sustainability for maximising profits on their devices.
       
        <br> Many smartphone manufacturers have recycling plants where old phones, tablets, laptops, and other electronics go to be broken down into their original components and reused. Apple has a large-scale iPhone dismantling machine called Daisy in the USA and the Netherlands, the machine quickly and effectively removes each component from an iPhone to either be reused in a newer model or broken down further into its raw materials to be used elsewhere in a new phone. This large-scale recycling allows Apple to reduce their carbon footprint and reduce the cost and quantity of raw materials used to improve profits and environmental impact caused by e-waste.
       
        <br> Google recently started making their own in-house smartphones called the Google Pixel series and as of the Pixel 6 released in October 2021 they even make their own in-house chipset called Tensor. This means Google has full control over the manufacturing process of their mobile phones allowing them to streamline their processes and reduce the total amount of waste generated by their factories. Google has also announced that they will provide software support to the Pixel 6 series of smartphones for at least 5 years which is on average more than other android phone manufacturers who are closer to about 3 years, this is a form of planned obsolescence as not receiving software support and updates can leave your device vulnerable to cyber-attacks and can force users to upgrade to a newer model of their phone even if their hardware is still functional.
       
        <br> The Chinese mobile phone manufacturer and retailer Xiaomi have poured large sums of funding into their Environmental Sustainable Goals scheme to reduce their affects on the environment by changing their chosen energy source to green options, reducing the amount of water they consume in their manufacturing process and improving their waste removal and recycling processes to use more recyclable components and reduce their quality of waste produced. In the manufacturing process of smartphones, a very small quantity of hazardous materials is used in the touchscreen, antennae, cameras etc. When disposing of a smartphone these materials should be properly recycled or wasted in a way that doesn't harm the environment, large tech businesses have tried to implement effective recycling processes into their manufacturing process but that requires the users to return their broken or old devises to the business which only a reported 12% of people do.</p>
